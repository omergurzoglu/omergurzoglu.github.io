    In this prototype , I focused on animation inverse kinematics , 
    movement and animation state machine, animation blend tree , third person camera follow system via cinemachine. I used unity's
    new input system. The state machine is open for expansion because most of the methods can be overridden in new states.
    The new input system comes handy in this situation because you can override OnMovePerformed() method in new states. But there are some problems on the approach, 
    we are overriding the foot position on the animation, this results in some odd instant elevation while climbing stairs.
    Maybe with unity's animation rigging package , we can move the body according to the feet position. I'll have to check it at some point.

      I made a hide and seek type of prototype because I wanted to play around with NavMeshAgents.
      The goal is to collect all three stars in 60 seconds without getting spotted by agents. You can distract the agents by throwing a ball
      on the walls or you can kill them directly by hitting them with the ball. I used the state pattern 
      for the agent script , so they would be open for expansion if I were to add more behaviors to them.
      I also used an oscillating capsule approach to move on sloped surfaces. Could have used a normal character controller 
      but I wanted to give the player a floating magnetic field effect.
