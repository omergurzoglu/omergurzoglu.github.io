        I wanted to try making a simple match3 game since it seemed like it would be a challange to write one.
        It was hard to write the algorithm , but with trial and error and a little help from the internet , I wrote 
        a decent algorithm. The gems are using scriptable objects as data so If we want to add new types of gems , we just need
        to make an SO asset for it and it will work without changing any logic. The grid is essentially a 2D array , and we 
        can adjust the width and height to whatever we want in the editor.
