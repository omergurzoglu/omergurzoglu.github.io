<div class="edu">  
    Briefly explaining my past , I always wanted a software related job , but I was 
    not sure on
    the specific type of it. I started from basics and learned the fundamental 
    computer science topics.
    The field of data science and the eventual approach towards successful natural 
    language processing models
    gained my attention and I started working on data science books for half a year.
     But unfortunately
    I had a burnout. I felt a pressure of being late , and I wanted do something more substantial.
    Thats when I decided to switch to game development. It was relatively more fun and easier for me 
    since I grew up playing games. With what I learned in computer science 
    I felt the algorithmic approach to a game while playing it and wanted to try doing it myself.

    I am currently enrolled in mathematics but after the first year , I stopped attending classes and moved my focus on developing games.
    I realised I was more productive in front of a computer compared to being in a class.

    I was taking computer science but I left in 2019 for personal reasons. Could have made better choices but it's in the past now.
